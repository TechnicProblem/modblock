<p>A custom lightweight kitchen-sink Minecraft modpack for 1.12.2.</p>

<hr>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>ModBlock 1 was a modpack I made in July 2017. It was from the beginning going to be a SkyBlock pack. I made it in MultiMC with 1.10.2 and without a good way to keep track of the versions, it was full of bugs and incompatible mods. I forgot some important mods and it was suddenly impossible to get iron. So I wanted to have a normal pack, and removed a bunch of mods which made the void world, and there I had it. It was bad, full of bugs and texture glitches, but I could play it. I played it for a bit, but got bored and started playing vanilla and other modpacks.
<br><br>
A year and a half goes by. And I sat and wanted to play some modded. I started the Twitch app and saw the first part of when I had tried to remake ModBlock in Twitch. Then I got interested. I opened MultiMC, looked at the old mod list and started to install all of the mods that were in the old pack on 1.12.2. Then I added some more mods and then looked through config files. And there I had it. My own modpack without a missing coremod error. Then I released it. End of story. Can I sleep now?
